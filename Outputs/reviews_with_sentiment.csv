We still waited another 5-10 minutes before they took her back. Someone took her vitals and did an EKG but never introduced he,rself so we are not sure if that was the nurse or not. They did not leave her on a monitor. They left her in the room for another 20 minutes or so without saying a word. She saw a doctor walking around aimlessly as if he were lost.

She said yes, and very rudely said "" I have someone coming in on an ambulance, I need to see him first.

1.0,"Wish I would have read these reviews before taking my son there yesterday but unfortunately when you have a """"respected hospital"""" in your back yard you expect to get above average medical care especially during an emergency. My son cut himself  pretty badly with a kitchen knife so we rushed him to the emergency room with a blood soaked towel wrapped around his hand at 1 o'clock. When we got there they took the towel off and wrapped it with an ace, without even looking at the injury. P,ut in a room and of course the obligatory ER wait even if blood is pouring out of your hand. Sorry to be long with this review but I want to make sure no one goes through what they put my son through. Wanted to do an xray but couldn't because blood was pouring our of his hand. Then they thought he cut the artery in the palm, called a hand specialist but didn't request one to come see him. They told us that he needed to be transported to Mem Hermann downtown for possible microsurgery, this without any confirmation from a hand specialist that he acutally cut the artery. At 5 fifteen an ambulance came to transfer him, this is in the middle of rush hour traffic. Arrived at  Mem Hermann at 6 thirty five and was put in the ER, remember this is one of the busiest ones in the city. We were told at Methodist that he was going to be put in a room when he got to Mem Hermann and a hand specialist was going to look at him, why that didn't happen at Methodist, I don't know.\r	,My son had to wait in that ER until 9 forty five before he was looked at by a doctor and all they did was clean the wound, irrigate it and close it with 4 stitches. He was released at 10 thirty, that's nine and a half hours to get 4 stitches to close his wound because of the incompetence of the ER staff and not doing the right thing. I found out that Mem Hermann at Memorial City had the microsurgery capabilities, 20 minutes away but of cours we were not given the option of taking him there.

1.0,"i was taken by ambulance to Methodist Willowbrook because they would take me only to the nearest hospital.  My leg was swollen and cherry pink.  The eventual diagnosis was cellulitis--a skin infection that can throw embolisms and cause fatal sepsis.  Almost all of the experience was a harrowing experience.  Examples:,--I suffer severe chronic pain treated by a path medication.  The doctors didn't want me to use it.  They promised me that equivalent pain relief would be provided.  In t,he ER it was supplied once.  In a hospital room I waited up to 1.5 hours for medication that was--at the most--barely adequate and--all too often--didn't take the edge off the pain.,--I was to receive a spinal tap.  it took over 6 hours before the procedure was done. It was was so painful I was screaming.  The folks administering the test were baffled why I had not been brought much earlier.  They'd been expecting me for hours.,--The hospital treated my diabetes using a protocol that's been out of date for at least a dozen years.  Using  my up to date protocol my blood sugar levels are like a person without  diabetes.  Prior to that my levels had been significantly above ADA accepted levels.,--At admission I provided a printout of the medications I take, the dosage and when it was to be taken.  In the 5 days in the hospital, the hospital never provided me all of the medications my doctors have prescribed for me.  I offered to use my own from home under their direction--offer refused.,--Medications were added that conflicted with medications I take.,--I was asked to provide a medication I always take.  It wasn't returned to me at time of discharge.,--A head administrative nurse--after one of the disasters--said she would check up on me every half hour.  I never saw her again.,--Communication was poor even for their own staff.  A doctor scheduled a procedure I was leery of and wanted to consult my primary care doctor. Years ago I'd undergone this procedure.  It took months for me to recover from the pain it caused--I was leery of doing it again. I told nursing staff the night prior I wouldn't be signing off on the procedure.  The doctor wasn't notified and came storming into my room asking me where I'd been.  He'd been waiting for me.  I'd expressed to him my hesitation when he'd told me his plan.  He wanted to do angio exploration of one part of my body.  A second doctor wanted to do the same exploration--but of another part of my body.

The hopsital did take her INSURANCE information so they could get paid and her temp and blood pressure and told her to wait.  She was in extreme pain and wanted to lay down as she was hurting all over.  The staff seemed unconcerned and told her that there was no beds available.

1.0,"I took a loved one to the ER at Methodist Willowbrook twice (due to the vicinity and the Methodist name).\r	,\r	,TAKE HEED:  This is NOT the same Methodist Hospital (quality, courteousness, attentiveness, and competency) that you get in the Texas Medical Center.  From the clerk that checks you into the ER to the nurses in triage...a lack of compassion for the patient despite the patient's expressed physical pain and worries.  The triage staff is very unsympathetic and seem to not enjoy, their work.\r	,\r	,I would have been able to let all of that go, except for the fact that I have just left the Methodist Hospital in the Texas Medical Center this morning realizing that the Willowbrook Methodist dismissively misdiagnosed a life threatening condition yesterday.  \r	,\r	,The Willowbrook Methodist sent my loved one home yesterday with a prescription for an antibiotic and told her she simply had """"a bug"""".  They did this, despite my loved one's suggestion to the attending doctor that it could be something more severe due to the unusual and acute pain she suffered from.  The doctor at Willowbrook Methodist ruled out anything more serious in a very dismissive manner.  \r	,\r	,Fortunately, my loved one knew others in the medical field whom she consulted with after leaving Methodist Willowbrook because she continued to experience the unusual and excruciating pain.   \r	,\r	,Hours later after she could bear her pain no longer and at the strong urging of her medical friends, she made the decision to get a second examination at the Texas Medical Center's Methodist Hospital.  After a much kinder (and quicker) ER registration, gracious and attentive evaluations from caring nurses (and interns), my loved one was diagnosed with a ruptured appendix.  \r	,\r	,Yesterday, had Methodist Willowbrook actually listened to her and took the effort to properly examine her, she would not have suffered as terribly as she did.   They allowed her to go home thinking that she had a normal infection when she had a condition that she could have died from if left untreated!  \r	,\r	,From here on, I will take the longer drive to the Texas Medical Center...I am now very suspicious of these outer lying, """"Mc Methodist Hospitals"""" in the suburbs.  Unfortunately, it appears that from the top down, they significantly fail to meet  the excellent  standards I had come to expect and trust from the Methodist name.\r	,\r	,I have a  strong feeling that the staff at this Willowbrook Methodist location simply arrive each day to receive their paychecks, whereas their amazing counterparts at Methodist in the Texas Medical Center appear to be sharp, passionate about their work, and respectful to every human being that checks into their hospital.  \r	,\r	,Again, I hope my experience can make the difference for someone else.  My loved one did not die from the misdiagnosis, though she suffered unnecessarily and tremendously from the pain of an undiagnosed ruptured appendix.  In fact, I am packing some of her personal belongings now and getting ready to visit her since she is now post-op.

1.0,"I clearly had the same PA (physician's assistant) that MadViking had. Went to the ER with what I suspected was another kidney stone (have passed more than 20), vomiting, etc. Got to the room fairly quickly, waited for about 15 minutes and was greeted by a very nice male nurse. Asked what was going on, I explained, he himself even said that stones are one of the most painful things the human can experience, was extremely empathetic, then said he was going to get me fixed up with somethi,ng to help my pain and would be right back. ,,About 15 minutes later walks in a younger female stating that she's the PA, and also asked what was going on. I again explained what had been going on for at this point several hours - excruciating pain, vomiting, etc. She tells me she's goi g to give me something to help the pain, as well as fluids (which I desperately wanted as it always helps the stone pass), and asks if I've ever had a specific NSAID they often give for stones. I told her yes, I've had it. Problem is that I'd taken two of that medication at home prior to coming, as well as an old Vicodin that I had leftover from a previous episode, none of which helped me. The nurse walks in a few minutes later and asked when exactly I'd had it, I tell him and he leaves. ,,He returned about 10 minutes later with a pill. A PILL. I'd been vomiting for hours, and they expect me to hold a pill down? I ask what it is and he tells me - it was essentially glorified Tylenol (that I already had at home). He also gave me a glass of water. ,,No fluids (as she previously stated), nothing for the nausea, nothing to truly help my pain. I had already had blood and urine taken, no results yet. At one point when the PA first came in, she starts telling me that my urine was fine - but then says ""oh wait, that's someone else - I haven't looked at yours"". Completely incompetent. ,,I felt as though I was treated like a lowly and a drug head. Absolutely disgusted! I've had MANY kidney stones unfortunately, and know the standard course of treatment that is usually followed for them - NONE of which I received (fluids, nausea and pain meds via IV).

I was put in a room for 2.5 hours and no one ever came to check on me. I was not clinically dehydrated upon arrival but after 4 hours of continuous vomiting in this ER I was severely dehydrated. I was told by the asian nurse that there was only one dr working the ER. WHAT????? After being in the room for so long my husband finally opened the door to the hallway to see what was going on. We could hear woman gossiping and laughing at the desk. He pushed the button to call for a nurse and the lady from admitting came in the room and asked, literally, ""what do you want?"" Why was she coming in? She is not even medical personnel! My husband asked for the nurse, when she finally showed up she was irritated to be there and very cold and curt. I begged for something to stop the vomiting and she coldly informed me that it was against the law for her to give me anything with out orders from the dr. I asked how much longer the dr would be and she responded that there were still several people in front of me that I would just have to ""deal with it."" I finally began crawling to get out of the bed and told her we would be leaving and going to a different hospital to which she responded that I should do what ever I wanted. When I put my shoes on and began walking out the door she began YELLING that she would call the police if I left with the IV port in my arm. (this was put in but never used, why???) I told her to call the police. She RAN out the door to go call the police. She was clearly more concerned about the port than my welfare. My husband convinced me to let her remove it and she beraded me the entire time. I have never experienced such treatment at a medical facility in all my life. When I reached another emergency room, my pulse was 117 and I was severely dehydrated. I required two bags of fluids and the dr was in shock that I was left so long without care. He explained that dehydration is very serious during pregnancy. I informed my OB about my experience and he said he has had 3 other patients complain about the care given here as well as other physicians. His entire practice no longer refers patients to this hospital. I will continue to warn everyone I know about this horrible facility.

And actually, the doctors were really working on my nerves, literally. I have hyperhidrosis, an overactive nervous system where my hands, feet, and armpits would excessively sweat. Thanks to the wonderful Dr. Garza and his special team, my hands and armpits are no longer embarrassing me (as for my feet, well that's another story and perhaps another surgery another day)!  To sum it all up in simple terms, the doctor removed the ganglion nerves from my spine between thoracic bones T3 and T4 and replaced the nerves with tubes. And voilà presto!!!....sweat be-gone!,My 2nd experience wasn't so great. I had a really bad and very rare reaction to some medication I was taking, which led me to my 7-day stay at this hospital.  I had to deal with a large team of various doctors: dermatologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, internal medicine, cardiologist, etc. Nobody knew how to deal with me or my symptoms. When I was in the bathroom, I had suddenly turned dark purple all over. My mother panicked and pulled the emergency cord. Nobody came! She pulled it 2 more times and still no attention from staff!!! She ran out to get help. I was soon given morphine and felt really good after that! ;) To make a long story short, I was given special skin cream and strong steroids and the problem went away on its own after months of waiting on the meds to flush out of my system.,The only positive thing from that horrific experience was meeting a great oncologist, Dr. Foote. He's funny, patient, caring, and knowledgeable.

1.0,"This Methodist location (Katy) is horrible & crooked. Their scheduling department is a joke & I had the most frustrating experience with them & the scheduler I got (Rashawnda) was extremely rude & was just a miserable person. I've never been treated like that. When I arrived their registration department was a mess. I waited over two hours, no one knew what they were doing, & when I went to ask what was going on & why I was still waiting I was told ""Sorry, you came at lunch, everyone is on break, there isn't much I can do about that. Just have a seat & we will get to you when we can get to you"". I was in shock & wanted to walk out but I needed the test done & had already taken off of work. After 2 hours I was registered & was told I owed more money than I should have paid. I tried pointing this out to them, but they had no idea what they were doing so I ended up just paying what they said. I later spoke with my insurance company who also agreed I over paid & they helped me get my money back, but, it took about 7 weeks for the hospital to do this. This is unacceptable & most people don't have money to give away because the registration department has no clue what they are doing & can't even read an insurance card. I finally made it to the radiology department & was further shocked. The lady at their check in desk was wrapped up in a blanket! Can you imagine? She was unprofessionally in appearance & behavior. She was gossiping with another employee when I walked up & you could tell from body language she was upset & she handed me a clip board without even turning to face me! She was still gripping to her co-worker. This is supposed to be Methodist mind you! I've never been treated like this. This is an open area & she was talking bad about other radiology technicians not doing their job & how their manager wouldn't fix it. Patients should NEVER hear things like this. I filled out the paperwork & gave it back to her & then waited over 45 minutes for my cat scan. The CT technician that came to get me was nice, but the only word that comes to mind that describes my experience with her is incompetent. Her personal appearance was horrible, her scrubs were dirty, wrinkled, & too large. She looked dirty & had greasy hair, & I, sorry to say she had a horrible order to her  both from her body & her mouth. When someone is poking on you & using needles on you, you want your surroundings & the people taking care of you to be clean. She tried 3 times to start an IV on me & couldn't get it. She was shaking & you could tell she had no idea what she was doing. She took the needle out at know point & I had blood leaking everywhere & she froze! I held a tissue to it! She finally got someone else to help her & they got it first try. This technician apologized for the other one & seemed frustrated with her. I'm assuming from her body language that this happens all the time. The cat scan room was dirty too. There was a sticky mess all over the floor & the machine & I stepped in it & told the technician but she just threw a towel over it! This is unacceptable! My experience at Methodist Hospital's West location was miserable & I will never go there again & I will tell my family & friends not to go there either. This hospital is clearly not an extension of the original Methodist Hospital in the medical center. As another review said I would rather drive to downtown Houston & pay to park then ever come here again. The kicker is I asked to speak to the radiology manager & when she finally came to talk to me she was rude & short with me as well. She clearly had no interest in talking to me & it seemed she was in a hurry. I asked if she could do anything & she said at this hospital they had no ""service recovery"", whatever that is, so her hands were tied.  Now, I'm not an expert in these things, but if you hear abad story of how a patient was treated & don't care to make it better,then you clearly don't belong in healthcare.

1.0,"I went to this ER after passing out several times at work. The only thing that got me back to a room in a timely manner (in my opinion) is that I happened to pass out while they were doing an EKG in the triage room. ,I warned the tech who was with me that I felt nauseous and might pass out again, and she hurried looking for a bag instead of making sure I was safe. I pointed out the emesis bags on the wall and in a rude tone she said she knew those were there but wanted something else for me. That's the last thing I remember.,As I came to, someone was shouting that I was having focal seizures (what?! No history of seizures for me or my family) and to get me into a room ASAP. They slapped oxygen on me without a pulse ox and wheeled me to a room where a nurse told me to change into a gown. I took the oxygen off so I could change and forgot to put it back on. The nurse came back in and checked my blood pressure but didn't check my oxygen saturation. He didn't say anything about seizure activity and I was crying, thinking that I had some new neurological disorder so I wasn't thinking clearly enough to ask apporpriate questions. He told me a doctor would be in soon.,We waited about an hour and the nurse came back in asking if a doctor has been in yet. I said no and he said he would be right back. A nurse practitioner (or maybe PA?) came in and looked at my labs, asked me my symptoms, I told her I was taking a beta-blocker and she wrote that down. She started walking out saying my labs looked great but I was probably dehydrated. How does that add up?,The nurse was nice enough but when he came to attach fluids to my IV he had (what looked like) dried blood on his hands. I'm not sure if he washed his hands before entering the room, but he definitely didn't put gloves on when touching my IV which is my preference when I care for patients.,An IV bolus and a couple hours later I was discharged with instructions regarding dehydration. How could I be dehydrated when my chemistry panel and urinalysis came back normal? I went to see my PCP the next day and he said stop taking the beta-blocker immediately, that's what's making me pass out. Easy enough fix. Told me to rest for  a few days without work and I should be OK. Luckily I didn't take my beta-blocker that morning because I assumed that's what the problem was. If I had kept taking it I would've ended up back in the ER. Thanks for incorrectly diagnosing me, Methodist ER. Twice.,I will never return to this ER. ,On a positive note, the outpatient experience I've had so far has been great with the providers (not so much their ancillary staff).

4.0,"This was the place that I spent most of my nights and weekends at for this year. I was here for 13 weeks straight because my grandmother got sick. She came in with pneumonia and came out with a pacemaker and kidney dialysis.  In the first part, we went to the ER. The ER doctors were finally helpful. They seemed nice and attentive. We had gotten Dr. Caspers again. He recognized my grandmother from years ago and spent the whole entire day in the ER waiting for a bed on the 5th floor. The nurses on the 5th floor are hit and misses. I understand that most nurses on the floor have 4 or 6 patients that they have to tend to but I don't think elderly patients get any love especially the ones that don't speak well or understand English for example my grandmother. Plus, I remembered there were other patients in the other room that the nurses had to yell at or one patient kept hitting the call button to get help but no one came to help.,Among all of the my grandma's nurses and doctors (trust me, she had so many during the morning and night shifts) I had to file a compliant against one of the nurses because she was rude and racist. I just felt that she is in better hands with the nurses and doctors. Plus, that is what nurses in the hospitals are supposed to do which is take care of their patients right? But us being there was to give my granny comfort and letting her know that we are there for her but it was putting a strand on my marriage since my husband would take care of my grandma in the day time, I would go after work until late or even sleep at the hospital. So, I had asked her nurse to take care of my granny because I just need a day to relax in my house on a Saturday since I haven't been home in months. She had the audacity to say, ""Ugh, how am I going to talk to her even though she (my granny) can't understand me"" I told her nicely that my granny can understand you and she can speak. It may be broken English but she can speak. I found that very rude because this hospitals have translators that the nurse could have called plus, I told the nurse that I don't live that far and she can always call me since my number is plastered on the walls.,Oh! Also!!! With non-speaking patients, please beware of some of the nurses that will try to get some kind of pills that aren't supposed to be in their system to knock them out. That has happened to us twice when I demanded to speak to the charge nurse and figured out why my granny received the meds. I saw it in front of me with my eyes when I specifically told a nurse not to give it to my granny and she went behind my back and did it. So, if you are able to spend time with your love ones every day, I recommend you that you should ask the nurses what kind of pills is your love one taking and remember it. Because the patients with no voice (can't speak English) can't talk for themselves.,Besides that few nurses we've had encountered, we spent many times in the ICU and NICU on the 3rd floor, the regular rooms on the 5th floor and 7th floor.
